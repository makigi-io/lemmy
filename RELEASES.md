# Lemmy v0.7.0 Release (2020-06-22)

## Breaking Change to our image server: Pictshare to Pict-rs migration guide

This release replaces [pictshare](https://github.com/HaschekSolutions/pictshare) with [pict-rs](https://git.asonix.dog/asonix/pict-rs), and a script must be run on your server to upgrade.

To update, run:

```
cd /lemmy
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dessalines/lemmy/master/docker/prod/docker-compose.yml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dessalines/lemmy/master/docker/prod/migrate-pictshare-to-pictrs.bash
sudo bash migrate-pictshare-to-pictrs.bash
```

You'll also have to update your nginx config, use the [one here](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/blob/master/ansible/templates/nginx.conf).

*You'll have to log in again to pick up your avatar*

- [Huge DB performance gains](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/issues/411) (everthing down to < `30ms`) by using materialized views. 
- Fixed major issue with similar post URL and title searching.
- Upgraded to Actix `2.0`
- Faster comment / post voting.
- Better small screen support.
- Lots of bug fixes, refactoring of back end code.

Another major announcement is that Lemmy now has another lead developer besides me, [@felix@radical.town](https://radical.town/@felix). Theyve created a better documentation system, implemented RSS feeds, simplified docker and project configs, upgraded actix, working on federation, a whole lot else.
